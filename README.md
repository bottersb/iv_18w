# San Francisco Bay Water Quality

Student work for the course 'Information Visualisation' at the TU Wien. 
When starting the web application the oxygen saturation percentage at 
sampling spots in the San Francisco Bay can be examined.
Samples were taken in the San Francisco Bay by the U.S. Geological Survey, more 
information  
[here](https://sfbay.wr.usgs.gov/access/wqdata/overview/index.html).

Not all dates have sampling data, choose March 1995 for an interesting sample. Select a 
specific location/sector on the map to see values taken for the selected month at different 
depths.

Low oxygen values are bad obvisouly, however, a very high oxygen concentration can be 
attributed to an overpopulation of plankton due to a high concentration of nutrients in the 
water. The nutrients usually originate from fertilizers seeping into the bay indicating 
pollution. 

The application can be started with the following command:

`npm install && node server.js`
